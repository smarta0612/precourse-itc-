    <h2>All about me</h2>

<p>As you are scrolling through these pages you happened to see my very first own website.  <em>Isn't it amazing?</em> I never coded a single line in my life before getting to this point.<br>
I have been working as a nurse for 10 years in intensive care units, emergency care departments, and operation rooms. I got my degree from the University and later on passed specialization courses for anesthesia.  All these places require a few things that I found convertible skills &knowledge. <br> I have been surrounded by all the beeping machines and electronic thingies, which I loved. I worked under pressure and have been very committed to accuracy. Developed problem-solving thinking, and I am a persistent stayer, but my time had come to leave nursing behind, and move forward and I am still growing as a newcomer. My freshly chosen path led me to the itc full-stack development precourse. <br>I want to see a bigger picture of tech-life because what I have just experienced in the precourse was<em>challenging</em> and <em>entertaining</em> at the same time. </p>
